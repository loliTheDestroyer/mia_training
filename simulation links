problem 3
I used simulIDE for this task, as Tinkercad used an old version of the arduino complier, alot of 
cpp functions and methods are not supportes such as the enum and struct.
The HEX file is included in the drive link. Please open the Serial moniter to test the 
outcome of the localization system

Bonus problem
-does not have a simulation, but the code was uploaded in a seperate file. The localization
  sytem was tested in problem 3
